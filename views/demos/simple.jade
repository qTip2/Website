	h3 Uncertainty principle
	p
		| In
		a(href='/wiki/Quantum_mechanics', title='Wikipedia: Quantum mechanics') quantum mechanics
		| , the
		b Heisenberg uncertainty principle
		| states by precise inequalities that certain pairs of physical properties,
		| such as position and
		a(href='/wiki/Momentum', title='Wikipedia: Momentum') momentum
		| , cannot be simultaneously known to arbitrarily high precision. That is, the more precisely one property is measured, the less
		| precisely the other can be measured.
	p
		| Published by
		a(href='/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg', title='Wikipedia: Werner Heisenberg') Werner Heisenberg
		| in 1927, the principle means that it is impossible to
		i determine
		| simultaneously both the position and the
		| momentum of an electron or any other particle with any great degree of accuracy or certainty. This is not a statement about researchers' ability to measure the quantities. Rather, it is a statement about the
		| system itself. That is, a system cannot be
		i defined
		| to have simultaneously singular values of these pairs of quantities. The principle states that a minimum exists for the product of the uncertainties
		| in these properties that is equal to or greater than one half of the
		a(href='/wiki/Reduced_Planck_constant', title='Wikipedia: Reduced Planck constant') reduced Planck constant
		| (
		i &#295;
		| =
		i h
		| /2&pi;).
	p
		| In quantum physics, a particle is described by a
		a(href='/wiki/Wave_packet', title='Wikipedia: Wave packet') wave packet
		| , which gives rise to this phenomenon. Consider the measurement of the position of a particle.
		| It could be anywhere. The particle's wave packet has non-zero
		a(href='/wiki/Amplitude', title='Wikipedia: Amplitude') amplitude
		| , meaning the position is
		b uncertain
		| – it could be almost anywhere along the wave packet.
		| To obtain an accurate reading of position, this wave packet must be 'compressed' as much as possible, meaning it must be made up of increasing numbers of
		a(href='/wiki/Sine_waves', title='Wikipedia: Sine waves') sine waves
		a(href='/wiki/Superposition_principle', title='Wikipedia: Superposition principle') added together
		| . The momentum of the particle is proportional
		| to the
		a(href='/wiki/Wavenumber', title='Wikipedia: Wavenumber') wavenumber
		| of one of these waves, but it
		i could be
		| any of them. So a more precise position measurement – by adding together more waves – means the
		| momentum measurement becomes less precise (and vice versa).
	p
		| The only kind of wave with a definite position is concentrated at one point, and such a wave has an indefinite wavelength (and therefore an indefinite momentum). Conversely, the only kind of wave with a definite
		| wavelength is an infinite regular periodic oscillation over all space, which has no definite position. So in quantum mechanics, there can be no states that describe a particle with both a definite position and a
		| definite momentum. The more precise the position, the less precise the momentum.
